I"	<p>If you follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/whoislaster">Twitter</a>, you’d know I found a hidden passion of mine during my short stint with Verizon: teaching! I found it incredibly rewarding teaching folks how to use and get the most out of their devices.</p>

<p>During my Apple training, I was given an opportunity to shadow some Creative appointments. A Creative is Apple’s version of a tutor or instructor. As a Creative, your main role at the Apple Store is that of instructor, whether guiding small groups to learn or helping individuals complete projects. You use your presentation skills to act as a facilitator, helping users get set up, get trained, and get going.</p>

<p>I’m dubbed a “FRS” or Family Room Specialist here at the Apple store in Bethesda. I’m essentially a troubleshooter for the mobile devices. After doing the shadowing with the Creative, I got that bug again… That teaching bug. I love the one-on-one and group learning situations. Helping folks understand that technology isn’t a <b>hurdle</b>, but rather a serious <b>tool</b> that can make their lives more convenient.</p>

<p>Following Dominique, the Creative I was assigned with, I was able to take away a lot from his teaching style. The rest of the Creatives were overly nice… which isn’t a problem, but I did see the benefit of being very direct on occasion.</p>

<p>There were many times when the customer would try and jump from one thing to the next but Dominique would bring their attention to the point at hand. An example would be Dominique’s goal of making sure they read every pop-up window from OS X. When the student would ask which password the prompt is asking for, he would ask them the same question back while pointing towards where they should be reading. </p>

<h3 id="take-aways"><i>Take Aways</i></h3>
<p>These techniques showed the customer slowing down to understand what they are clicking through is a must. When you slow down, that is when the true learning happens. When you have to think about your next step. The device is giving you all the details you need.</p>

<p>How can I include teaching or education into my life to feel fulfilled? I need a way to mesh teaching with technology. <i>Hmmm….</i></p>
