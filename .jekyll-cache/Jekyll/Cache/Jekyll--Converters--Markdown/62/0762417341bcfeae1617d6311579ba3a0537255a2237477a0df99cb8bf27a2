I"¶<p>Fixing my hosting and deploy process has been on my todo list for months, but somehow consistently took a backseat. Iâ€™m happy to announce I finally addressed it and am now 100% hosted on Github.</p>

<h3 id="why-its-awesome">Why Itâ€™s Awesome</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The deploy process is fantastically simple. I just push to a gh-pages branch and itâ€™s live in seconds.</li>
  <li>Easy deploys mean Iâ€™m more likely to address bugs/issues in a timely manner.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s free (unless you want private repositories).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-limitation">The Limitation</h3>
<p>Github pages only serve vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, meaning if your project requires server-side scripting or a traditional database, youâ€™re out of luck.</p>

<h3 id="deploying-in-style">Deploying In Style</h3>
<p>If your site is raw HTML/CSS/JS, deploying is as simple as merging any new changes from a working branch into the gh-pages branch and pushing. Youâ€™re done. Changes to your site will be reflected almost immediately.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-my-new-workflow">I Love My New Workflow</h3>
<p>Using Github as a hosting provider is amazing. If you have projects built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (or that compile to static code), I strongly suggest giving <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> a chance. Combining <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">version control</a> with hosting seems like a no brainer in retrospect. Since version control already means pushing files to a remote server, why not use that same system to deploy the whole site to a remote server?</p>

<p>Faster, simpler, semi-automated deploys means I get to focus on the fun stuff like writing, and coding.</p>
