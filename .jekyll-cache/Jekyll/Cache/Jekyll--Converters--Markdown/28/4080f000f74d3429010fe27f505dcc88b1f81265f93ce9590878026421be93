Today I drove home my 2016 Volkswagen Golf R! I’ve done alot of stalking this car on dealership lots.</p>

<p>This is the current iteration of the iconic R-Line from Volkswagen. The original R that started it all was the 2004 R32. The “32” signifying the 3.2L VR6 Engine. The intoxicating sound played a huge part in shooting that car into legendary status with German automotive aficionados. Two iterations of the R later, the MKVII (generation 7) Golf R is on the road! Due to the world shifting to more efficient engines, Volkswagen dropped from 3.2L VR6 to a 2L turbo engine.</p>

<p>What’s funny is, I actually didn’t like how the new R looked when it first debuted. I thought it didn’t picture well. It wasn’t until one night on the way home on 270, an Oryx White R passed my driver side, gracefully commanding the lane. The street lights were hitting that pearl SO PERFECT and immediately I decided I was all about the MKVII. I found myself all over the forums doing research on the car. I NEEDED a break from black. Black is easily one of the best colors on almost any car, but I simply needed a break from the maintenance of keeping the black clean and swirl free.</p>

<p>Fast forward to October and I’ve finalized a deal with a fellow enthusiast forum member out of the classifieds section for a 2016 Oryx White MK7 Golf R w/ DCC, NAV, &amp; DAP w/ Parking Sensors! I got over the “want” for it to be brand new and let him eat the depreciation. Picked it up for the price of a new GTI and it feels like and absolute brand new car still to me even with 17,500 miles.</p>

<p>For perspective, I got my first car at 54,000 miles and again, it felt brand new to me! The 3 hour drive home was AMAZING!  Gosh, I love this machine. I took alternate roads down from PA back to Maryland that paralleled the highway to get a taste of this car through the curves. Man, I tell ya’, one of the best handling cars I’ve driven with my limited experience. I love how the AWD system just wants you to give it more throttle so it can dig you out the corner. I’m looking forward to sharing my progress with this amazing car!</p>
