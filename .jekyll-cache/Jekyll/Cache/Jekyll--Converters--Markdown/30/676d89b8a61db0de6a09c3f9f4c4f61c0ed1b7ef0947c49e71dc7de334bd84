Today my 2005 Volkswagen Jetta GLI was delivered! A surprise from my Father for keeping the grades up.</p>

<p>This Jetta GLI is considered a “special edition.” The final version of the 4th generation GLI, the redesigned heir to a racy GLI bloodline, keeps it’s tradition alive with a 6-speed manual transmission, sports suspension, 18” BBS RC wheels, Recaro seats, and lowered front and rear valence skirts. Also, this version comes with the AWP engine code which gives the car a thirty horsepower advantage over the regular GLI. Bringing the turbo-charged 1.8 liter engine to 180 horsepower.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to adding some tasteful modifications to the car!</p>
