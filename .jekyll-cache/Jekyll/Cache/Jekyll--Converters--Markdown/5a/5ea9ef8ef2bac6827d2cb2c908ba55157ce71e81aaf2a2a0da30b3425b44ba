I"s<p><a href="http://ma.tt">Matthew Mullenweg</a> linked to a very interesting article about the ever controversial Uber service that is spreading rapidly from city to city. Iâ€™d love to share it with you all!</p>

<p>Emily Guendelsberger of the <a href="http://citypaper.net/emilyg/">Philadelphia City Paper</a> put in 100 undercover hours as an UberX driver in Philadelphia and <a href="http://citypaper.net/uberdriver/">wrote about the experience</a>. In this fascinating and well written read, she focused on the economics of the entire experience of being an Uber driver.</p>

<p><em>SPOILER:</em> This is a long read!</p>
