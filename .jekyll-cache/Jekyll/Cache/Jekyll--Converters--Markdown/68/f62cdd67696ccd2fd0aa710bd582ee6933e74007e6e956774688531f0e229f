<p>Just kidding, it’s actually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird_hawk-moth">Hummingbird Hawk-Moth</a>. However, after doing some research, it turns out they often are mistaken for an actually hummingbird because of their flight patterns, color, and shape. I also read their ability to beat their wings up to 85 beats per second allow them to hover and fly in all different directions like that of a true hummingbird, hence it’s name!</p>

<p>When he showed me, I asked in my head, “you saw a moth during daylight hours?” It turns out, unlike most moth’s, the Hummingbird Moth is diurnal - meaning more active during the daytime, rather than nighttime.</p>

<p>In the photos, you can see the moth’s straw-like “proboscis” in action sipping nectar from flowers. They travel with their proboscis in a curled position and extend it when approaching a flower.</p>
