<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hey! I'm Jonathan. I'm a nerd with a penchant for intellectually stimulating content and the internet. I'm into new technologies, automotive culture, reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, and indulging in one of the greatest delights in life: eating!</p>

<p>I attend college here in Maryland studying Cyber Security. Currently learning <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>.</p>

<p>If you want, send me a <a href="http://twitter.com/whoislaster">tweet.</a> I would love to hear from you!</p>
